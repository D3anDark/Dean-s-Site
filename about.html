            Hello, I am <b>DeanDark</b>, or Junior Developer. I'm learning to program on my own, in a bigger way. And I've been learning it since I was 10 years old, and at the age of 7 I had my first exposure to the computer exclusively. Sometimes I couldn't see what I was doing (Sometimes it still happens).
            <br>
            &nbsp
            <br>
            I like playing video games, programming, astronomy, geopolitics, learning new interesting things, etc. Sometimes in my free time I read books (this is really rare, because of my dyslexia, sometimes I have difficulty with this), and I draw.
            <br>
            Most often I play games such as - Stardew Valley, Overwatch 2, Minecraft, Osu!, Euro Track Simulator 2, etc.
            <br>
            &nbsp
            <br>
            I can such languages as Polish (Native), English, and so a bit of Silesian and Italian (This Italian please take at a distance).
            <br>
            And the programming languages I can do are HTML, CSS, Python, TypeScript, SQL and want to learn more of them!
            <br>
            &nbsp
            <br>
            I have also been moderating the bot community <a href="https://startit.bot/" target="_blank">StartIT</a> for a while now.
